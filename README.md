# Posey
DCC agnostic pose library

Posey is a work in progress

The purpose of this tool is to provide animators with a single, searchable pose libaray that is compatible across common DCCs such ans Blender, Maya and MotionBuilder. The goal is to use as little API (maya.cmds, pyfbsdk, ...etc) specific code as possible and utilize matrices as the basis of copying and pasting poses since the applications I mentioned above all use matrices in some format.
